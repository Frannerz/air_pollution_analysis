# Air Pollution in Hammersmith

## Setup
1. git clone https://github.com/Frannerz/air_pollution_analysis

2. Install dependencies:
```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib requests seaborn openpyxl jupyter```

3. Please open in Jupyter Notebook on your browser, so that you can see colours and sections

4. Run each cell in the air_pollution_hammersmith jupyter notebook starting in the `styling and imports` section. Note: some files are very large and will take some time to load

5. The API request is commented out as the data has already been saved. To test the API response, uncomment the text. You will need to add an API key from: https://openweathermap.org/api 

## Organistation of notebook
- The notebook is organised into 6 main sections:
    1. Styling and imports
    2. Data loading and cleaning
    3. Sub-question 1: What is the main cause of air pollution in the borough and what factors are influencing levels of pollutants?
    4. Sub-question 2: What has been the impact of schemes such as ULEZ and Covid on reducing air pollution and how can this inform future policies?
    5. Sub-question 3: What is the impact of air pollution on our health and the NHS?
    6. Summary of findings and recommendations

- Each section is collapsed under a `<h2>` orange heading and should expand when you run the code
- Within each section, you will find smaller sub-questions in yellow. These are also headings and can be expanded and collapsed
- Further guideposts are in purple to organise longer sections of code
- Any observations or notes are in blue
- A final summary and recommendations can be found in pink in the final section. These link to the results and conclusion in our report.
